   The coldest months on average on Mars are the 3rd and 4th months, and the warmest are 8th and 9th month.
4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:he highest.
5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
   The distance between peaks when plotting Number of Terrestrial days v. temp(C) is about 675 days.
